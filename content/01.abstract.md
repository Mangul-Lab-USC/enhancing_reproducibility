## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Computational methods have reshaped the landscape of modern biology.
While the biomedical community is increasingly dependent on
computational tools, the mechanisms ensuring open data, open software,
and reproducibility are variably enforced by academic institutions,
funders and publishers. Publications may describe the software for which
source code is unavailable, documentation is incomplete or unmaintained,
and analytical source code is missing. Publications that lack this
information compromise the role of peer review in evaluating technical
strength and scientific contribution. Such flaws also limit any
subsequent work that intends to use the described software. We herein
provide recommendations to improve reproducibility, transparency, and
rigor in computational biologyâ€”precisely the values which should be
emphasized in foundational life and medical science curricula. Our
recommendations for improving software availability, usability, and
archival stability aim to foster a sustainable data science ecosystem in
biomedicine and life science research.
