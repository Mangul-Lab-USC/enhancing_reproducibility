## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Computational methods have reshaped the landscape of modern biology.
While the biomedical community is increasingly dependent on
computational tools, the mechanisms ensuring open data, open software,
and reproducibility are variably enforced by academic institutions,
funders, and publishers. Publications may present academic software for
which essential materials are or become unavailable, such as source code
and documentation. Publications that lack such information compromise
the role of peer review in evaluating technical strength and scientific
contribution. Incomplete ancillary information for an academic software
package may bias or limit any subsequent work produced with the tool. We
provide eight recommendations across four different domains to improve
reproducibility, transparency, and rigor in computational
biology â€” precisely the main values which should be emphasized in life
science curricula. Our recommendations for improving software
availability, usability, and archival stability aim to foster a
sustainable data science ecosystem in biomedicine and life science
research.
